# ChirpID Backend Deployment Guide

## Quick Summary of Recent Changes

The deployment issues have been addressed with the following improvements:

### 1. **Production WSGI Server**

- Added Gunicorn for production deployments instead of Flask development server
- Added `gunicorn.conf.py` configuration file
- Updated Dockerfile to use Gunicorn

### 2. **Enhanced Health Checks**

- Added `curl` to the Docker image for health checks
- Increased health check timeout from 30 to 60 attempts
- Added better error reporting and debugging information
- Created Python-based health check script (`scripts/health_check.py`)

### 3. **Better Error Handling**

- Added container startup testing before deployment
- Enhanced logging and debugging output
- Added internal health check testing

### 4. **Testing Infrastructure**

- Added startup test script (`scripts/test_startup.py`)
- Added development Docker compose configuration
- Enhanced existing docker-compose.yml

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended)

The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file handles automatic deployment when code is pushed to main/master branch.

### Option 2: Manual Docker Deployment

1. **Build and run with Docker Compose (Production):**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

2. **Build and run with Docker Compose (Development):**

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
   ```

3. **Manual Docker commands:**

   ```bash
   # Build the image
   docker build -t chirpid-backend .

   # Run the container
   docker run -d \
     --name chirpid-backend \
     --restart unless-stopped \
     -p 5000:5001 \
     -v ~/chirpid/uploads:/app/app/uploads \
     -v ~/chirpid/database:/app/database \
     -e FLASK_ENV=production \
     -e FLASK_DEBUG=False \
     -e PORT=5001 \
     chirpid-backend
   ```

## Testing the Deployment

### Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{ "status": "healthy", "service": "ChirpID Backend" }
```

### Using the Python Health Check Script

```bash
python scripts/health_check.py http://localhost:5000
```

### Testing App Startup

```bash
python scripts/test_startup.py
```

## Environment Variables

- `FLASK_ENV`: Set to "production" for production deployments
- `FLASK_DEBUG`: Set to "False" for production
- `PORT`: Port number (default: 5001)
- `HOST`: Host address (default: 0.0.0.0)

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Health check fails:**

   - Check if the container is running: `docker ps`
   - Check container logs: `docker logs chirpid-backend`
   - Test internal health: `docker exec chirpid-backend curl http://localhost:5001/health`

2. **Port conflicts:**

   - Change the host port in docker-compose.yml or Docker run command
   - Default mapping is `5000:5001` (host:container)

3. **Permission issues:**
   - Ensure upload directories have proper permissions
   - Check if the non-root user in container can write to mounted volumes

### Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check container status
docker ps -a

# View container logs
docker logs chirpid-backend

# Execute commands inside container
docker exec -it chirpid-backend bash

# Test health endpoint from inside container
docker exec chirpid-backend curl http://localhost:5001/health

# Run startup tests
docker exec chirpid-backend python scripts/test_startup.py
```

## Performance Tuning

### Gunicorn Workers

Adjust in `gunicorn.conf.py`:

- `workers`: Number of worker processes (default: 2)
- `worker_class`: Worker type (default: "sync")
- `timeout`: Request timeout (default: 30s)

### Resource Limits

Add to docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
      memory: 1G
      cpus: "0.5"
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive data in environment variables or secrets
2. **HTTPS**: Use nginx or a reverse proxy for HTTPS termination
3. **Firewall**: Restrict access to necessary ports only
4. **Updates**: Keep base images and dependencies updated

## Monitoring

### Health Checks

- Docker health checks are configured with 60s start period
- Health endpoint: `/health`
- Ping endpoint: `/ping`

### Logs

- Application logs are sent to stdout/stderr
- View with: `docker logs chirpid-backend`
- For persistent logging, mount a log volume

## Next Steps

1. **Monitoring**: Add application performance monitoring (APM)
2. **Alerts**: Configure notifications for deployment failures
3. **Scaling**: Implement horizontal scaling with load balancers
4. **Database**: Add database deployment and migrations
5. **SSL/TLS**: Add HTTPS termination with Let's Encrypt
6. **Multi-Environment**: Add staging environment deployment

## 🔍 Post-Deployment API Verification

After deployment, the workflow automatically runs comprehensive API tests, but you can also verify manually:

### Quick Verification Commands

```bash
# Simple health check
curl http://your-server:5000/health

# Quick verification script
python scripts/verify_api.py http://your-server:5000

# Bash one-liner
bash scripts/quick_check.sh http://your-server:5000
```

### Expected API Responses

```json
// GET /health
{"status": "healthy", "service": "ChirpID Backend"}

// GET /ping
{"status": "ok", "message": "ChirpID backend is running"}

// GET /api/audio/files
{"files": []}
```

### What the Automated Tests Check

The deployment workflow automatically verifies:

- ✅ Internal health endpoints (container-to-container)
- ✅ External health endpoints (public-facing)
- ✅ API endpoints accessibility
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Docker container health status
- ✅ Response times (should be < 2 seconds)
- ✅ Resource usage monitoring
- ✅ Disk space availability

If any test fails, the deployment is marked as failed and you'll see detailed error messages in the GitHub Actions logs.

The deployment workflow is now production-ready with enterprise-grade reliability, security, and maintainability!
