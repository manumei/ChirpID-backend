We need to ensure that the amount of samples *after test* remains balanced. I picked a cap of 100 and min of 75, but that means birds with 130, 200, etc. get 100, and the birds with 74 get less because of dev/test split. Dev split ends up with many at 100, some below 60.
Maybe higher MIN or lower CAP could help.



prompt markdowns:
1. test.md



Notes for agent:
- output says most times im using around 0.1G out of 16GB, underutilizing heavily
- I want the loading tqdm bar to actively show current train_acc and val_acc
- 



- implement ModelTesting base functionality with audio_process(), and make it print the process as it calculates for each segment each SoftMax, etc.
- Try sweeps with vs without ADAM (asi ya me saco de encima eso)
