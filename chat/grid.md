# Grid Search

Add me a new cell in ModelTraining.ipynb that sets up configurations so I can do a grid search of configs for the model. I want to be able to set and test combinations of:

- ADAM Opt: bool
- estop_thresh: int
- batch_size: int
- use_class_weights: bool
- l2: float
- lr_exp: bool

Edit util.py if necessary to accomodate these optional configurations if some aren't yet adapted.
