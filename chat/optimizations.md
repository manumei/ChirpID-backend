# Optimization Opportunities in ChirpID-backend

This document identifies potential optimizations found during the modular refactoring analysis. These are documented for future consideration but not yet implemented.

## 1. Training Optimizations

### Data Loading

- **Data preprocessing pipeline**: Normalization and standardization are done repeatedly. Could cache preprocessed data.

### Model Training

- **Mixed precision training**: No mixed precision training is currently used. Could implement automatic mixed precision (AMP) for faster training.
- **Gradient clipping**: No gradient clipping is implemented. Could help with training stability.

### Cross-validation

- **Parallel fold training**: K-fold cross-validation runs sequentially. Could implement parallel training of folds where GPU memory allows. Make sure it optimizes efficiency, not conflicting with any other optimizations already applied to the training functions, unless they are obsolete or inferior in comparison.
- **Early stopping optimization**: Early stopping only considers validation loss. Could implement multi-metric early stopping.

## 2. Memory and Storage Optimizations

### Memory Management

- **Tensor memory optimization**: Large tensors are kept in memory throughout training. Could implement better memory management.
- **Garbage collection**: No explicit garbage collection. Could implement strategic garbage collection in memory-intensive operations.

## 5. Experiment Management Optimizations

### Results Tracking

- **Experiment logging**: No structured experiment logging. Could implement MLflow or Weights & Biases integration.

### Model Management

- **Model versioning**: Basic model saving without versioning. Could implement proper model versioning and registry.

## 6. Visualization Optimizations

### Plotting Efficiency

- **Figure memory management**: Matplotlib figures are not explicitly closed. Could implement better figure lifecycle management.
- **Interactive plots**: Static plots only. Could implement interactive plotting for better exploration.

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Easy wins)

1. Add explicit figure closing in plotting functions
2. Implement gradient clipping in training loops
3. Add mixed precision training option

### Medium Priority (Moderate effort)

1. Implement spectrogram caching
2. Parallel fold training

### Low Priority (Major refactoring)

1. GPU-accelerated spectrogram generation
2. Comprehensive experiment tracking
3. Interactive visualization dashboard

## Notes

- These optimizations should be implemented incrementally
- Performance benchmarks should be established before optimization
- Consider trade-offs between complexity and performance gains
- Some optimizations may require additional dependencies
