# ChirpID Backend - Connection Testing Guide

This guide helps you validate the connection between the React Native frontend and Flask backend.

## Prerequisites

##### Flask Backend Setup

Run this from the ChirpID-backend repository root:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##### React Native Frontend Setup

Make sure you have cloned the [chirpid front-end repository](https://github.com/manudelp/chirpid.git).
Run this from the chirpid/ root:

```bash
npm install
```

## Step 1: Get Your Local IP Address

Run this script from the ChirpID-backend root to get your computer's local IP address:

```bash
python get_ip.py
```

Go to the front-end repository, and update the `.env` file:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:5001
```

If the file does not exist, create it at the chirpid/ root and just add that line.

## Step 2: Start the Flask Backend

```bash
cd "\ChirpID-backend"
python run.py
```

You should see:

```bash
Starting ChirpID Backend Server...
Server will be available at: http://0.0.0.0:5001
Local network access at: http://<your-ip>:5001
```

## Step 3: Test Backend Endpoints

Run the test script to verify all endpoints work:

```bash
cd "\ChirpID-backend"
python test_server.py
```

Expected output:

```bash
Testing ChirpID Backend Server...
========================================
Ping test: 200
Response: {'status': 'ok', 'message': 'ChirpID backend is running'}

Health test: 200
Response: {'status': 'healthy', 'service': 'ChirpID Backend'}

Upload test: 200
Response: {'success': True, 'message': 'Audio uploaded and processed successfully', ...}

========================================
Test Results:
Ping: âœ“
Health: âœ“
Upload: âœ“

All tests passed! ðŸŽ‰
```

## Step 4: Start the React Native App

Navigate to the root of the front-end repository at chirpid/ again, and run this:

```bash
npx expo start
```

## Step 5: Test Frontend Connection

1. **Upload Test**:

   - Record an audio clip using the record button
   - Tap "Send" to upload to the backend
   - Check for success/error messages

2. **File Upload Test**:
   - Go to the "Upload" tab
   - Select an audio file
   - Verify it uploads successfully

## Troubleshooting

### Backend Connection Issues

**Solutions**:

1. Verify the Flask server is running on port 5000
2. Check that your IP address in `.env` is correct
3. Ensure both devices are on the same network
4. Try disabling firewall temporarily
5. Check if Windows Defender is blocking the connection

### Upload Failures

**Problem**: "Upload Failed" errors

**Solutions**:

1. Check the Flask server logs for error messages
2. Verify CORS is properly configured
3. Ensure the audio file format is supported (wav, mp3, ogg, flac, m4a)
4. Check network connectivity

### Network Configuration

**For LAN Access**:

- Backend binds to `0.0.0.0:5001` (all interfaces)
- CORS allows all origins for development
- React Native uses absolute URI with local IP

**Firewall Settings**:

- Allow Python through Windows Firewall
- Allow inbound connections on port 5000

## API Endpoints

- `GET /ping` - Connection test
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `POST /api/audio/upload` - Audio file upload

## Features Implemented

âœ… Flask server binds to 0.0.0.0:5001  
âœ… CORS enabled for all origins  
âœ… React Native uses correct local IP via EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL  
âœ… /ping route implemented in Flask  
âœ… Network error logging and alerts  
âœ… FormData POST requests with absolute URIs  
âœ… Correct MIME type (audio/wav)  
âœ… Proper error handling on fetch failure  
âœ… Retry mechanisms for failed requests

## Development Notes

- Backend runs in debug mode for development
- Both upload methods (record + file picker) use the same API
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- All requests use absolute URIs with the configured API base URL
